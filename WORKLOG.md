- Project created as the successor to Arduino4x4Cube.
- Chose 4-leg addressable LEDs (APA106-F5 / PL9823-F5) over multiplexed common-anode RGB LEDs: no driver ICs, no layer transistors, three wires to the cube, full brightness, Nano is sufficient.
- Wiring plan written (`docs/wiring-plan.html`): leg bend plan, layer serpentine, stack elevation, controller schematic, parts list, build order and the FastLED (x, y, z) -> index mapping.
- Open items before buying: confirm the leg order of the chosen LED part on a breadboard; decide 5 mm vs 8 mm LEDs; decide 25 mm pitch (100 mm cube) vs larger.
- Nothing built or coded yet.
